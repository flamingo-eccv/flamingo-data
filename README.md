Repo to share the **largest yet annotated Forms data** for the paper "Document Structure Extraction using Prior based High Resolution Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation" accepted at ECCV 2020:
[Paper link](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123730647.pdf)

A part of the dataset is now available here: [Data link](https://github.com/forms-data-structures/forms-data). The dataset comprises of **400 annotated forms with rich and fine-grained annotations for different levels of structures in a hierarchy** - text, widgets, fields, tick-type choice groups etc.
